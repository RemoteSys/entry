## Magic commands

Magic commands run in `jupyter notebook` as in the` ipython` console. Two types of commands are available:


 - command line commands, preceded by a single `%` character e.g. `%ls` - see [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#line-magics). 

 - commands to be executed in `jupyter notebook` cells, preceded by a double `% ` sign, e.g. ` %%html ` - see [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cell-magics)
